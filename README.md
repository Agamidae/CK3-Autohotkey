# CK3-Autohotkey

A collection of hotkeys for playing Crusader Kings 3 with a screen reader, using [OCR Support mod](https://github.com/Agamidae/CK3-OCR/wiki)

Run Autohotkey.exe while playing the game. You may move the file wherever is more convenient for you,

If you have a Spanish keyboard where slash isn't near Enter, run Spanish Autohotkey instead.

If you are already using Autohotkey, feel free to use and customize the ahk scripts.
